Steve McKeogh is a full stack senior web developer from sunny London. I started in the web game way back in 1999 - when I picked up a coding book and got hooked on code.Over the years I have worked with many big household names (Microsoft, Apple, Disney, BBC, Time Out, Skechers to name just a few) and I am always keen to adopt new technologies early (frontend and backend) such as PHP Laravel, Node.js, React and Redux.I have a huge passion for front and backend web development which I have been doing in parallel to each other for the length of my career. I am always looking for a new challenge.
